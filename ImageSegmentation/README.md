# Edge Detection

The objective of this project is to implement and test an image segmentation algorithm. This segmentation algorithm firstly uses the “gradient watershed” algorithm to split regions and then uses the merge part of the “split merge” algorithm to merge adjacent regions with similar intensity.


## Design

File created: segment.cpp

1. Find watershed regions by calling the “watershed” function.

2. Create two lists with the size of the total number of regions that generated by the watershed function. One list is used to store the size of each region, the other one is used to store the average intensity of each region.

3. Create an adjacency list (2D vector) which is used to keep track of regions and their adjacent regions

4. Loop over image from left to right and then loop over image vertically again, in the meantime, update the adjacency list. Then, remove duplicate values in the adjacency list.

5. Loop over image and use “Set” to merge adjacent regions whose average intensity difference within a threshold.

6. Modify the average intensity image and the region image and write them out.
